# Upload And Cover Audio

> This API covers an audio track by transforming it into a new style while retaining its core melody. It incorporates Suno's upload capability, enabling users to upload an audio file for processing. The expected result is a refreshed audio track with a new style, keeping the original melody intact.

### Parameter Usage Guide

* When customMode is true (Custom Mode):
  * If instrumental is true: style, title and uploadUrl are required
  * If instrumental is false: style, prompt, title and uploadUrl are required
  * prompt length limit by model:
    * **V4**: Maximum 3000 characters
    * **V4\_5, V4\_5PLUS, V4\_5ALL & V5**: Maximum 5000 characters
  * style length limit by model:
    * **V4**: Maximum 200 characters
    * **V4\_5, V4\_5PLUS, V4\_5ALL & V5**: Maximum 1000 characters
  * title length limit by model:
    * **V4 & V4\_5ALL**: Maximum 80 characters
    * **V4\_5, V4\_5PLUS & V5**: Maximum 100 characters
  * uploadUrl is used to specify the upload location of the audio file; ensure the uploaded audio does not exceed 8 minutes in length.
    * **Important**: When using the **V4\_5ALL** model, the uploaded audio file must not exceed **1 minute** in length.
* When customMode is false (Non-custom Mode):
  * Only prompt and uploadUrl are required regardless of instrumental setting
  * prompt length limit: 500 characters
  * Other parameters should be left empty

### Developer Notes

1. Recommended settings for new users: Set customMode to false, instrumental to false, and only provide prompt and uploadUrl. This is the simplest configuration to quickly test the API and experience the results.
2. **V4\_5ALL Model Upload Limit**: When using the V4\_5ALL model, the uploaded audio file must not exceed **1 minute** in length.
3. Generated files will be deleted after 15 days
4. Ensure all required parameters are provided based on customMode and instrumental settings to avoid errors
5. Pay attention to character limits for prompt, style, and title to ensure successful processing
6. Callback process has three stages: text (text generation complete), first (first track complete), complete (all tracks complete)
7. You can use the Get Music Generation Details endpoint to actively check task status instead of waiting for callbacks
8. The uploadUrl parameter is used to specify the upload location of the audio file; please provide a valid URL.

                    The URL for uploading audio files, required regardless of
                    whether customMode and instrumental are true or false.
                    Ensure the uploaded audio does not exceed 8 minutes in
                    length.
                  example: https://storage.example.com/upload
                prompt:

                  description: >-
                    A description of the desired audio content.  

                    - In Custom Mode (`customMode: true`): Required if
                    `instrumental` is `false`. The prompt will be strictly used
                    as the lyrics and sung in the generated track. Character
                    limits by model:  
                      - **V4**: Maximum 3000 characters

                    - In Non-custom Mode (`customMode: false`): Always required.
                    The prompt serves as the core idea, and lyrics will be
                    automatically generated based on it (not strictly matching
                    the input). Maximum 500 characters.  
                      Example: "A short relaxing piano tune" 
                  example: A calm and relaxing piano track with soft melodies

                  description: >-
                    The title of the generated music track.  

                    - Required in Custom Mode (`customMode: true`). Character
                    limits by model:

                    Enables Custom Mode for advanced audio generation
                    settings.  

                    - Set to `true` to use Custom Mode (requires `style` and
                    `title`; `prompt` required if `instrumental` is `false`).
                    The prompt will be strictly used as lyrics if `instrumental`

                      - If `true`: Only `style` and `title` are required.  
                      - If `false`: `style`, `title`, and `prompt` are required (with `prompt` used as the exact lyrics).  
                    - In Non-custom Mode (`customMode: false`): No impact on
                    required fields (`prompt` only). Lyrics are auto-generated
                    if `instrumental` is `false`.
