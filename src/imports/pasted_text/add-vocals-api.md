# Add Vocals

> This endpoint layers AI-generated vocals on top of an existing instrumental. Given a prompt (e.g., lyrical concept or musical mood) and optional audio, it produces vocal output harmonized with the provided track.

### **Key Capabilities**

* Accepts an existing instrumental via uploadUrl, with optional prompt-based stylistic input.
* Supports control parameters including:
  * prompt, style, tags, negativeTags (define lyrical content and vocal style)
  * vocalGender, styleWeight, weirdnessConstraint, audioWeight, callBackUrl  .
* Returns a taskId, supports the same 14-day retention and three-stage callback model as the instrumental endpoint  .

### **Typical Use Cases**

* Music platforms or tools enabling topline creation and rapid prototyping of lyrical ideas.
* Collaborative songwriting or co-creation workflows, where lyrics or vocal styles are iteratively tested over instrumental drafts.

### Parameter Usage Guide

Required parameters for all requests:

* `uploadUrl`: Valid instrumental audio file URL
* `prompt`: Description of the desired vocal content and style
* `title`: Title for the generated vocal track (max 100 characters)
* `style`: Music and vocal style (e.g., "Jazz", "Pop", "Classical")
* `negativeTags`: Vocal styles or characteristics to exclude
* `callBackUrl`: URL to receive completion notifications

Optional parameters for enhanced control:

* `vocalGender`: Preferred vocal gender ('m' for male, 'f' for female)
* `styleWeight`: Style adherence weight (0.00-1.00)
* `weirdnessConstraint`: Creativity/novelty constraint (0.00-1.00)
* `audioWeight`: Audio consistency weight (0.00-1.00)
* `model`: Model version used for generation. Allowed values: `V4_5PLUS` (default), `V5`

Audio requirements:

* Input Type: Instrumental or backing track audio files
* File Format: MP3, WAV, or other supported audio formats
* Quality: Clear instrumental tracks work best for vocal addition
* Accessibility: Ensure uploaded audio URLs are publicly accessible

### Developer Notes

1. Generated vocal tracks are retained for 15 days before being deleted
2. Ensure you have proper rights to use the uploaded audio content
3. Use clear, well-mixed instrumental tracks for best results
4. Be specific about vocal style in your prompt (e.g., "smooth jazz vocals", "energetic pop vocals")
5. Callback process has three stages: text (text generation), first (first track complete), complete (all tracks complete)
6. You can use the Get Music Generation Details endpoint to actively check task status instead of waiting for callbacks

                    content.  

                    - The more detailed your prompt, the better the vocal
                    generation will match your vision.

                    The URL of the uploaded audio file to add vocals to.  

                    - Required.  

                    - Must be a valid audio file URL accessible by the system.  

                    - The uploaded audio should be in a supported format (MP3,

                    The URL to receive task completion notifications when vocal
                    generation is complete. The callback process has three
                    stages: `text` (text generation), `first` (first track
                    complete), `complete` (all tracks complete). Note: In some
                    cases, `text` and `first` stages may be skipped, directly
                    returning `complete`.

                    - For detailed callback format and implementation guide, see
