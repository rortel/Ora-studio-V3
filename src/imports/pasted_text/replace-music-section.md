# Replace Music Section

> Replace a specific time segment within existing music.

### Usage Guide

* This interface can replace specific time segments in already generated music
* Requires providing the original music's task ID and the time range to be replaced
* The replaced audio will naturally blend with the original music

### Parameter Details

* **Required Parameters**:
  * `taskId`: Original music's parent task ID
  * `audioId`: Audio ID to replace (selected from the generated music list)
  * `prompt`: Prompt describing the replacement segment content
  * `tags`: Music style tags
  * `title`: Music title
  * `infillStartS`: Start time point for replacement (seconds, 2 decimal places)
  * `infillEndS`: End time point for replacement (seconds, 2 decimal places)

* **Optional Parameters**:
  * `negativeTags`: Music styles to exclude
  * `callBackUrl`: Callback address after task completion

### Time Range Instructions

* `infillStartS` must be less than `infillEndS`
* Time values are precise to 2 decimal places, e.g., 10.50 seconds
* The replacement time range must be between 6 and 60 seconds
* Replacement duration should not exceed 50% of the original music's total duration

### Developer Notes

* Replacement segments will be regenerated based on the provided `prompt` and `tags`
* Generated replacement segments will automatically blend with the original music's preceding and following parts
* Generated files will be retained for 14 days
* Query task status using the same interface as generating music: [Get Music Details](./get-music-details)

        ### Usage Guide

        - This interface can replace specific time segments in already generated
        music

        - Requires providing the original music's task ID and the time range to
        be replaced

        - The replaced audio will naturally blend with the original music


        ### Parameter Details

        - `taskId`: Required parameter, original music's parent task ID

        - `audioId`: Required parameter, audio ID to replace (selected from the
        generated music list)

        - `prompt`: Required parameter, prompt describing the replacement
        segment content

        - `tags`: Required parameter, music style tags

        - `title`: Required parameter, music title

        - `infillStartS`: Required parameter, start time point for replacement
        (seconds, 2 decimal places)

        - `infillEndS`: Required parameter, end time point for replacement
        (seconds, 2 decimal places)

        - `negativeTags`: Optional parameter, music styles to exclude

        - `callBackUrl`: Optional parameter, callback address after task
        completion


        ### Time Range Instructions

        - `infillStartS` must be less than `infillEndS`

        - Time values are precise to 2 decimal places, e.g., 10.50 seconds

        - Replacement duration should not exceed 50% of the original music's
        total duration


        ### Developer Notes

        - Replacement segments will be regenerated based on the provided
        `prompt` and `tags`

                    (infillEndS - infillStartS) must be between 6 and 60
                    seconds.
                  example: 10.5

                    Callback URL for task completion. The system will send a
                    POST request to this URL when replacement is complete,
                    containing task status and results.


                    - Your callback endpoint should be able to accept POST
                    requests containing JSON payloads with replacement results

                    - For detailed callback format and implementation guide, see
                    [Replace Music Section
                    Callbacks](https://docs.sunoapi.org/suno-api/replace-section-callbacks)

                    - Alternatively, you can use the get music details interface
                    to poll task status
                  example: https://example.com/callback
