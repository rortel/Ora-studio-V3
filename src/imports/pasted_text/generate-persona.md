# Generate Persona

> Create a personalized music Persona based on generated music, giving the music a unique identity and characteristics.

### Usage Guide

* Use this endpoint to create Personas (music characters) for generated music
* Requires the taskId from music generation related endpoints (generate, extend, cover, upload-extend, mashup) and audio ID
* Customize the Persona name and description to give music unique personality
* Generated Personas can be used for subsequent music creation and style transfer
* Optionally specify vocalStart and vocalEnd to define the time range (10-30 seconds) for analysis. If not provided, defaults to 0.0 and 30.0 respectively

### Parameter Details

* `taskId`: Required parameter, can be obtained from the following endpoints:
  * [Generate Music](./generate-music) (`/api/v1/generate`)
  * [Extend Music](./extend-music) (`/api/v1/generate/extend`)
  * [Upload And Cover Audio](./upload-and-cover-audio) (`/api/v1/generate/upload-cover`)
  * [Upload And Extend Audio](./upload-and-extend-audio) (`/api/v1/generate/upload-extend`)
* `audioId`: Required parameter, specifies the audio ID to create Persona for
* `name`: Required parameter, assigns an easily recognizable name to the Persona
* `description`: Required parameter, describes the Persona's musical characteristics, style, and personality
* `vocalStart`: Optional parameter, start time (in seconds) of the audio segment to analyze. Default value is 0.0. Must be between 0 and the audio duration, and the segment length (vocalEnd - vocalStart) must be between 10-30 seconds.
* `vocalEnd`: Optional parameter, end time (in seconds) of the audio segment to analyze. Default value is 30.0. Must be between 0 and the audio duration, and the segment length (vocalEnd - vocalStart) must be between 10-30 seconds.
* `style`: Optional parameter, music style label to help categorize the Persona

### Developer Notes

* **Important**: Ensure the music generation task is fully completed before calling this endpoint. If the music is still generating, this endpoint will return a failure
* **Model Requirement**: Persona generation supports taskId from music generated with models V4 and above
* It is recommended to provide detailed descriptions for Personas to better capture musical characteristics
* The returned `personaId` can be used in subsequent music generation requests to create music with similar style characteristics
* You can apply the `personaId` to the following endpoints:
  * [Generate Music](./generate-music)
  * [Extend Music](./extend-music)
  * [Upload And Cover Audio](./upload-and-cover-audio)
  * [Upload And Extend Audio](./upload-and-extend-audio)
* Each audio ID can only generate a Persona once

### Parameter Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```json With Default Values theme={null}
  {
    "taskId": "5c79****be8e",
    "audioId": "e231****-****-****-****-****8cadc7dc",
    "name": "Electronic Pop Singer",
    "description": "A modern electronic music style pop singer, skilled in dynamic rhythms and synthesizer tones",
    "style": "Electronic Pop"
  }
  ```

  ```json With Custom Time Range theme={null}
  {
    "taskId": "5c79****be8e",
    "audioId": "e231****-****-****-****-****8cadc7dc",
    "name": "Electronic Pop Singer",
    "description": "A modern electronic music style pop singer, skilled in dynamic rhythms and synthesizer tones",
    "vocalStart": 10,
    "vocalEnd": 30,
    "style": "Electronic Pop"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Ensure that the music generation task corresponding to the taskId is complete and the audioId is valid.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Providing detailed and specific descriptions for Personas helps the system more accurately capture musical style characteristics.
