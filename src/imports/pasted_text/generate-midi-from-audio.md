# Generate MIDI from Audio

> Convert separated audio tracks into MIDI format with detailed note information for each instrument.

### Usage Guide

* Convert separated audio tracks into structured MIDI data containing pitch, timing, and velocity information
* Requires a completed vocal separation task ID (from the Vocal Removal API)
* Generates MIDI note data for multiple detected instruments including drums, bass, guitar, keyboards, and more
* Ideal for music transcription, notation, remixing, or educational analysis
* Best results on clean, well-separated audio tracks with clear instrument parts

### Prerequisites

<Warning>
  You must first use the [Vocal & Instrument Stem Separation](/suno-api/separate-vocals-from-music) API to separate your audio before generating MIDI.
</Warning>

| `audioId`     | string | **Optional.** Specifies which separated audio track to generate MIDI from. This audioId can be obtained from the `originData` array in the [Get Vocal Separation Details](/suno-api/get-vocal-separation-details) endpoint response. Each item in `originData` contains an `id` field that can be used here. If not provided, MIDI will be generated from all separated tracks. |

### Developer Notes

* The callback will contain detailed note data for each detected instrument
* Each note includes: `pitch` (MIDI note number), `start` (seconds), `end` (seconds), `velocity` (0-1)
* Not all instruments may be detected - depends on audio content
* **Billing:** Check current per-call credit costs at [**https://sunoapi.org/dashboard**](https://sunoapi.org/dashboard)

      description: >-
        Convert separated audio tracks into MIDI format with detailed note
        information for each instrument.


        ### Usage Guide

        - Convert separated audio tracks into structured MIDI data containing
        pitch, timing, and velocity information

        - Requires a completed vocal separation task ID (from the Vocal Removal
        API)

        - Generates MIDI note data for multiple detected instruments including
        drums, bass, guitar, keyboards, and more

        - Ideal for music transcription, notation, remixing, or educational
        analysis

        - Best results on clean, well-separated audio tracks with clear
        instrument parts


        ### Prerequisites

        - You must first use the Vocal & Instrument Stem Separation API with
        `type: split_stem` to separate your audio before generating MIDI


        ### Parameter Details

        - `taskId` identifies a completed vocal separation task 

        - `callBackUrl` receives MIDI generation completion notifications

        - `audioId` (optional) specifies which separated audio track to generate
        MIDI from. Obtain this ID from the `originData` array in the Get Vocal
        Separation Details response. If not provided, MIDI will be generated
        from all separated tracks.


        ### Developer Notes

        - MIDI generation typically takes 30-90 seconds depending on audio
        length and complexity

        - The callback will contain detailed note data for each detected
        instrument

        - Each note includes: pitch (MIDI note number), start (seconds), end
        (seconds), velocity (0-1)

        - Not all instruments may be detected - depends on audio content

        - Generated MIDI data is retained for 14 days

                    The URL to receive MIDI generation task completion updates.
                    Required for all MIDI generation requests.


                    - System will POST task status and MIDI note data to this
                    URL when generation completes

                    - Callback includes detailed note information for each
                    detected instrument with pitch, timing, and velocity

                    - Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with
                    JSON payload containing MIDI data

                    - For detailed callback format and implementation guide, see
                    [MIDI Generation
                    Callbacks](/suno-api/generate-midi-callbacks)

                    - Alternatively, use the Get MIDI Generation Details
                    endpoint to poll task status
                  example: https://example.callback

                    Optional. Specifies which separated audio track to generate

                    `originData` array in the Get Vocal Separation Details
                    endpoint response. Each item in `originData` contains an
                    `id` field that can be used here. If not provided, MIDI will
                    be generated from all separated tracks.
