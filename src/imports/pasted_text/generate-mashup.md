# Generate Mashup

> Create a mashup by blending two audio files together to generate new music.

### Usage Guide

* Use this endpoint to create mashups by combining two audio files
* Requires exactly 2 audio file URLs in the uploadUrlList array
* Supports both custom and non-custom modes for different generation styles
* Generated mashups can be used to create Personas for subsequent music generation

### Parameter Details

* `uploadUrlList`: Required parameter, array containing exactly 2 audio file URLs to be mashed up together. Both URLs must be valid and accessible.
* `customMode`: Required parameter, enables Custom Mode for advanced audio generation settings
* `prompt`: Required parameter. Character limits by model:
  * **V4**: Maximum 3000 characters (Custom Mode) or 500 characters (Non-custom Mode)
  * **V4\_5, V4\_5PLUS, V4\_5ALL & V5**: Maximum 5000 characters (Custom Mode) or 500 characters (Non-custom Mode)
* `style`: Required in Custom Mode. Character limits by model:
  * **V4**: Maximum 200 characters
  * **V4\_5, V4\_5PLUS, V4\_5ALL & V5**: Maximum 1000 characters
* `title`: Required in Custom Mode. Character limits by model:
  * **V4 & V4\_5ALL**: Maximum 80 characters
  * **V4\_5, V4\_5PLUS & V5**: Maximum 100 characters
* `instrumental`: Determines if the audio should be instrumental (no lyrics)
* `model`: Required parameter, the model version to use for audio generation
* `vocalGender`: Optional parameter, preferred vocal gender for generated vocals (m or f)
* `styleWeight`: Optional parameter, weight of the provided style guidance (0.00–1.00)
* `weirdnessConstraint`: Optional parameter, constraint on creative deviation/novelty (0.00–1.00)
* `audioWeight`: Optional parameter, weight of the input audio influence (0.00–1.00)
* `callBackUrl`: Required parameter, the URL to receive task completion notifications

### Developer Notes

1. **Audio Requirements**: Ensure both audio files in uploadUrlList are accessible and valid. The system will blend these two audio files to create the mashup.
2. **Generated files**: Generated files are retained for 15 days before being deleted
3. **Ensure all required fields**: Provide all required fields based on the customMode and instrumental settings to avoid errors
4. **Character limits**: Respect the character limits for prompt, style, and title to ensure successful processing
5. **Callback process**: Callback process has three stages: text (text generation), first (first track complete), complete (all tracks complete)
6. **Task status**: You can use the Get Music Generation Details endpoint to actively check task status instead of waiting for callbacks
7. **Persona generation**: Generated mashups can be used with the Generate Persona endpoint to create Personas for subsequent music generation

### Parameter Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Custom Mode with Instrumental theme={null}
  {
    "uploadUrlList": [
      "https://storage.example.com/audio1.mp3",
      "https://storage.example.com/audio2.mp3"
    ],
    "customMode": true,
    "instrumental": true,
    "style": "Electronic Dance",
    "title": "Mashup Mix",
    "model": "V4_5ALL",
    "callBackUrl": "https://api.example.com/callback"
  }
  ```

  ```json Custom Mode with Vocals theme={null}
  {
    "uploadUrlList": [
      "https://storage.example.com/audio1.mp3",
      "https://storage.example.com/audio2.mp3"
    ],
    "customMode": true,
    "instrumental": false,
    "prompt": "[Verse] Blending two worlds together, creating something new",
    "style": "Electronic Pop",
    "title": "Fusion Mashup",
    "model": "V5",
    "vocalGender": "f",
    "styleWeight": 0.7,
    "callBackUrl": "https://api.example.com/callback"
  }
  ```

  ```json Non-custom Mode theme={null}
  {
    "uploadUrlList": [
      "https://storage.example.com/audio1.mp3",
      "https://storage.example.com/audio2.mp3"
    ],
    "customMode": false,
    "prompt": "A dynamic mashup combining two different music styles",
    "model": "V4_5ALL",
    "callBackUrl": "https://api.example.com/callback"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Ensure that both audio file URLs in uploadUrlList are accessible and valid. The system requires exactly 2 URLs to create the mashup.
</Note>

<Tip>
  For best results, use audio files with similar characteristics (tempo, key, etc.) to create more harmonious mashups. You can also use the generated mashup to create a Persona for subsequent music generation.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  The uploadUrlList must contain exactly 2 audio file URLs. Providing more or fewer URLs will result in an error.
</Warning>

                    settings.  

                    - Set to `true` to use Custom Mode (requires `style` and
                    `title`; `prompt` required if `instrumental` is `false`).
                    The prompt will be strictly used as lyrics if `instrumental`
                    is `false`.  

                    - Set to `false` for Non-custom Mode (only `prompt` is
                    required). Lyrics will be auto-generated based on the
                    prompt.
                  example: true
                prompt:
                  type: string
                  description: >-
                    A description of the desired audio content.  

                    - In Custom Mode (`customMode: true`): Required if
                    `instrumental` is `false`. The prompt will be strictly used
                    as the lyrics and sung in the generated track. Character
                    limits by model:  
                      - **V4**: Maximum 3000 characters  
                      - **V4_5, V4_5PLUS, V4_5ALL & V5**: Maximum 5000 characters  
                      Example: "A calm and relaxing piano track with soft melodies"  
                    - In Non-custom Mode (`customMode: false`): Always required.
                    The prompt serves as the core idea, and lyrics will be
                    automatically generated based on it (not strictly matching
                    the input). Maximum 500 characters.  
                      Example: "A short relaxing piano tune"
                  example: A calm and relaxing piano track with soft melodies
                style:

                    - Required in Custom Mode (`customMode: true`). Examples:
                    "Jazz", "Classical", "Electronic". Character limits by
                    model:  
                      - **V4**: Maximum 200 characters  
                      - **V4_5, V4_5PLUS, V4_5ALL & V5**: Maximum 1000 characters  
                      Example: "Classical"  
                    - In Non-custom Mode (`customMode: false`): Leave empty.
                  example: Classical
                title:
                  type: string
                  description: >-
                    The title of the generated music track.  

                    - Required in Custom Mode (`customMode: true`). Character
                    limits by model:  
                      - **V4 & V4_5ALL**: Maximum 80 characters  
                      - **V4_5, V4_5PLUS & V5**: Maximum 100 characters

                      - If `true`: Only `style` and `title` are required.  
                      - If `false`: `style`, `title`, and `prompt` are required (with `prompt` used as the exact lyrics).
