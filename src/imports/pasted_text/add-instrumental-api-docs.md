# Add Instrumental

> This endpoint generates a musical accompaniment tailored to an uploaded audio file — typically a vocal stem or melody track. It helps users instantly flesh out their vocal ideas with high-quality backing music, all without needing a producer.

### **Key Capabilities**

* Accepts uploadUrl of an existing audio file (usually vocals or stems).
* Supports fine-grained customization via parameters such as:
  * tags and negativeTags (musical style controls)
  * styleWeight, audioWeight, weirdnessConstraint (stylistic & creative blending)
  * vocalGender, title, callBackUrl for metadata & workflow control  .
* Returns a taskId for tracking, and results are retained for 14 days. Callback workflow includes three stages: text, first, and complete  .

### **Typical Use Cases**

* Singers or melody writers who want instant fuller arrangements around their vocal inputs.
* Applications like karaoke platforms, demo-generation tools, or co-creation interfaces that allow users to experiment with accompaniment styles easily.

### Parameter Usage Guide

Required parameters for all requests:

* `uploadUrl`: Valid audio file URL (MP3, WAV, or other supported formats)
* `title`: Title for the generated instrumental track (max 100 characters)
* `tags`: Desired style and characteristics for the instrumental
* `negativeTags`: Styles or instruments to exclude
* `callBackUrl`: URL to receive completion notifications

Optional parameters for enhanced control:

* `vocalGender`: Preferred vocal gender for any vocal elements ('m' or 'f')
* `styleWeight`: Style adherence weight (0.00-1.00)
* `weirdnessConstraint`: Creativity/novelty constraint (0.00-1.00)
* `audioWeight`: Audio consistency weight (0.00-1.00)
* `model`: Model version used for generation. Allowed values: `V4_5PLUS` (default), `V5`

Audio requirements:

* File Format: MP3, WAV, or other supported audio formats
* Quality: Higher quality input generally produces better instrumental results
* Accessibility: Ensure uploaded audio URLs are publicly accessible and stable

### Developer Notes

1. Generated instrumental files are retained for 15 days before being deleted
2. Ensure you have proper rights to use the uploaded audio content
3. Be specific with tags to get the desired instrumental style (e.g., "acoustic guitar, soft piano, ambient")
4. Use negative tags effectively to avoid unwanted elements
5. Callback process has three stages: text (text generation), first (first track complete), complete (all tracks complete)
6. You can use the Get Music Generation Details endpoint to actively check task status instead of waiting for callbacks

                    The URL to receive task completion notifications when
                    instrumental generation is complete. The callback process
                    has three stages: `text` (text generation), `first` (first
                    track complete), `complete` (all tracks complete). Note: In
                    some cases, `text` and `first` stages may be skipped,
                    directly returning `complete`.
